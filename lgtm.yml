  # We aren't concerned about this because magics are discouraged by code style

  # Code documentation is very much appreciated, but some code blocks are just
  # hardcoded values to boost performance. To document every single code block
  # is just insane in those cases. Take for example:
  # data/text/encoding/single_byte_encoding.xpp
  - exclude: cpp/poorly-documented-function
  # Static variables, in this case constants are very useful to prevent magics
  # in code. Obviously, the code is never finished, so having broad utilities
  # that may've been unused is great, since writing them when you need them
  # reduced performance and fun :)
